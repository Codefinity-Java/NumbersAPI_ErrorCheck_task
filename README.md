# Description
The task is to work on the code from the previous task, and add error checking, exactly the way we did in the video. You don't need to add error checking for `int.Parse` methods.

**Note:** This task does not have test cases. You can verify your solution by comparing it to the given solution code.

### Hints
> Enclose the request code inside a try-catch block to ensure it doesn't fail in case the url is wrong. This is because the url can be wrong in case the user gives some abnormal input;

> Check if the request was successful by using the `IsSuccessStatusCode` attribute of the response class;
